This study examines the impact of Armeniaâ€™s public policy on the career choices of its youth, particularly focusing on applications to STEM faculties. Using a difference-in-differences estimation approach, the research evaluates how government policy initiatives impact educational preferences and contribute to human capital development in strategic sectors. The analysis, based on data from Armenian government sources and educational institutions, reveals that the 2023's policy has led to a significant 76% increase in applications to policy-impacted STEM programs during the academic years impacted by the policy. The study highlights the role of government incentives such as draft deferment and tuition fee reimbursement in shaping educational choices. The findings suggest that targeted policy interventions can effectively align education with national strategic objectives, particularly in post-Soviet contexts.
